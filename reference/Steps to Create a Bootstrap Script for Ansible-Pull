Set Up a Web Server to Host the Script (credit MS Copilot):

    You'll need a simple web server to host your Ansible playbook and bootstrap script. This can be done using Nginx, Apache, or even a basic Python HTTP server.

Create Your Ansible Playbook:

    Write your Ansible playbook that will configure your workstation. Save it as bootstrap.yml or a similar name.

    Example bootstrap.yml:

- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: Update and upgrade apt packages
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        upgrade: dist

Create the Bootstrap Script:

    This script will download the Ansible playbook and execute it using ansible-pull.

    Save the script as bootstrap.sh:

#!/bin/bash

# Update package manager and install Ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ansible

# Run ansible-pull with the provided playbook URL
ansible-pull -U http://your-server-ip/bootstrap.yml -i localhost

Make sure the script is executable:

chmod +x bootstrap.sh

Host the Script on Your Web Server:

    Place bootstrap.sh and bootstrap.yml in your web server's document root.

    For example, with Nginx, place these files in /var/www/html/.

Test the Script:

    On a new machine or VM, run the following command to execute the bootstrap script:

curl -s http://your-server-ip/bootstrap.sh | sudo bash

        This will download and execute the script, which in turn will download and execute your Ansible playbook.

Summary

By following these steps, you'll create a simple setup where you can quickly provision new machines using curl and a hosted bootstrap script. This approach leverages ansible-pull to ensure that your machines are configured as per your playbook.
